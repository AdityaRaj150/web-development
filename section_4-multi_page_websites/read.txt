file paths -
1. absolute file paths ex- c:/users/roman/OneDrive/Desktop/dog.png
2. relative file paths

working directory- the folder in which the file you are working on is located
../dog.png - goes up a level from the working directory and then access the 
dog.png located in that folder
./cat.png - stays in the same directory and access cat.png

in vs code -
assets\images means there is a image folder inside assets folder

boilerplate in html is how the code is structured
<!DOCTYPE html> <!--this tells the browser that we are using html-5-->
<html lang="en"> <!--this sets the language to english-->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!--this allows the use of all the characters like 
                            special characters-->
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>hello world</h1>
</body>
</html>

head element is doesn't include any content, it's
just necessary for website to render
