every colour has a unique hex decimal you can use it as an alternative to the colour name
- use popular palette from website like colour hunt for your website

1 Pixel is 1/96 of an Inch
1 Point is 1/72 of an Inch
1em is 100% the size of the parent element
1rem is 100% the size of the root element

in case of font-family: arial, cursive
here arial is a specific typeface and cursive is generic typeface
so we can add generic type face also in case specific typeface does't work!

-also if the the typeface has more than one word then you must use double quotes, otherwise not necessary!

The CSS Box Model:
you can create box using <div></div> html tag

border width: 0px 20 px 30px 40px 
this starts with top and goes anticlockwise

examples of how to set borders-

border: 20px solid black
border: 10px dashed red

note- border width: 0px 20px [use it after defining border type and colour that is border: solid black;]
here top and bottom are set 0px whereas left & right are set to 20px
