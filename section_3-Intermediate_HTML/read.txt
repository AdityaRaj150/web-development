<tag attribute = value> content </tag>
example <a href=www.google.com>google search engine</a>
<a></a> is called anchor element- it converts the content into a hypertext

html attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the content behaviour
there are some specific attributes that can only be applied in a specific tag. example- href can only be used in an anchor element
there are global attribute that can be used with any element. example- draggable 
<a draggable=true> hello </a>

image element- <img src="link" /> (it's a void elements)
src is the attribute which takes the image link
