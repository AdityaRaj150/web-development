HOW TO MAKE WEBSITES RESPONSIVE -  FOR IT WE USE THE FOLLOWING -    
flexbox, media query, css grid, bootstrap

FLEXBOX:
flex: 1 distributes entire area equally in all boxes(flexitems)
whereas if you do .box1{flex: 2} and .box2{flex: 1} then they will occupy spaces in the ration 2:1
this makes the websites responsive since it divides in this ratios keeping in mind the size of website.
