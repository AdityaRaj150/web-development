CSS cascading

    css cascading where the priority is 
    position < specificity < type < importance

    position - whatever is at the bottom should get more priority

    specificity - element tag < class < attribute < id 

    type - external < internal < inline

    importance - using importance tag 
    ex- green !important

    note- if in the class attribute there is a space, it means there is another class attribute 
    example- <p class="first second-one">
    here p tag has two class first and second- one

COMBINING CSS SELECTORS
    see the pictures
    note- in chaining always start with element
    example-
    h1.title#new-era is correct
    .titleh1#new-era is wrong


CSS POSITIONING

relative: will be set relative to what should have been it's actual position
absolute: will be set relative to a positioned parent element or to the top left corner of the body of the website
fixed: will be set relative to the to left corner of window


to select all the element, use-
* {
    property: value
}

combining selector- let's say you want to select all the child element of a class box-
.box * {
    propery: value;
}
