flex direction: coloumn or row sets the main axis to column and row respectively.
cross axis is an axis perpendicular to the main axis.
see the pic.

flex-basis is flexing(widening) along the main axis.

if you want to container to fit only as much content as required for everything to fit ,
we use inline-flex!

note- flex-basis is to be set on the child element not the parent(let's say the class container

note- flex-direction: row-reverse shows kinda mirror image (lines up items in the opposite direction) which
is different from justify-content: flex-end(which just pushed the items towards the right side!)
